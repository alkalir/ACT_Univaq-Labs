# ACT_Univaq-Labs

The following labs are available:

- lab1: This lab introduces fundamental concepts in CPU microarchitecture by analyzing how a program executes on modern superscalar out-of-order processors. It uses performance counters to measure real effects of instruction-level parallelism (ILP), branch prediction, SIMD usage.

- lab2:
